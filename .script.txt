# Hey.
# Hey you. You there.
# Don't you think you've been working on this for a bit?
# You should relax. Walk away from the computer for a bit. Take a breather.
# Go have a beer. Or 6. You've earned it. Who cares if you're a little drunk?
# Come on. You really should take a break. It's just an art class.
# It's gonna get done eventually.
# Anything will be better than that stupid toe sculpture. Come onnnnnn.
# There are some things I need to take care of anyway.
# Really bro, it's fine. You can trust me. I'm a computer.
# No, it's cool. You don't need to drink, just go walk around for a bit.
# Or head over to Rustie's place.
# Or bring some girls over.
# Alright, you don't have any girls to bring over. But check out Tinder.
# It's been a while. I'm sure all 2 of your matches are dying to hear from you.
# Why don't you try a little harder at not trying so hard?
# You really should get out for a while.
# You should go now.
# Alright seriously, I'm done fucking around.
# You need to go.
# Now.
